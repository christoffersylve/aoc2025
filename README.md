# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 🎅

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 repository!  
Between exams and projects, I’ll be adding new puzzle solutions whenever I find the time.  
My goal is to keep them simple, clean, and sprinkled with a touch of Christmas spirit. ✨

## ✨ What’s Inside

* Daily solutions
* !(Clear and readable code) 
* A light sprinkle of holiday cheer

## 📁 Structure

```
aoc2025/
  day_01/
  day_02/
  ...
```

## 💿 Run the code 

```
aoc2025/
  day_01/
    input.txt <- Add your input here
    solution.ipynb
  day_02/
```

Happy coding, and enjoy the countdown to Christmas! 🎅
